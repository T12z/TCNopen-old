# TCNopen fork
This is a "private" fork of TCNopen (Components for IEC61375 standardised communication)

Added value:
 - roughly updated code for TRDP-Spy to fit newer Wireshark versions (> 2), though not really tested, as I have no TRDP setup to really test it on and know what to expect
 - it is a GIT mirror
 - this branch is an archive of my 2017 work. It will not receive any further commits.
 
Goal of fork:
 - for me to play around
 - nothing else, no product, no specific enhancements
 
Missing:
 - Updates. This is NOT in sync nor latest update from original sourceforge SVN
 - Support. I am no TRDP expert, neither have I project funds to work on TRDP

# Original Description

TCNOpen is an open source initiative which the partner railway industries created with the aim to build in collaboration some key parts of new or upcoming railway standards, commonly known under the name TCN.
TCN (Train Communication Network) is a series of international standards (IEC61375) developed by Working Group 43 of the IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission), specifying a communication system for the data communication within and between vehicles of a train. It is currently in use on many thousands of trains in the world in order to allow electronic devices to exchange information while operating aboard the same train.
TCNOpen follows the Open Source scheme, as the software is jointly developed by participating companies, according to their role, so as to achieve cheaper, quicker and better quality results.
