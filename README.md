# TCNopen fork
This is a "private" fork of TCNopen (Components for IEC61375 standardised communication)

## Goal of fork
 - for me to play around
 - nothing else, no product, no specific enhancements

## In 2017
 - I updated the TRDP-Spy plugin to wireshark 2.5. Later on, Upstream have updated the plugin to a 2.x version as well, so I split this off to an archive branch https://github.com/T12z/TCNopen/tree/wireshark2.5 
 - I also started into looking how to pair that up with SCADE but got off-tracked into "paid work". Currently it is nothing useful. Don't bother looking. If there is more interest in this topic send me some kind of thumbs-up, so I feel like I should get back onto it.
 
## In 2018
 - So I synced an update, yet haven't really looked into it. But I did trash the branch history, sorry for that!
 - In future, I will try to separate upstream and my work, so the git-svn shuffling might work smoother.
 
## Missing
 - Updates. This is NOT in sync nor latest update from original sourceforge SVN
 - Support. I am no TRDP expert, neither have I project funds to work on TRDP

# Original Description

TCNOpen is an open source initiative which the partner railway industries created with the aim to build in collaboration some key parts of new or upcoming railway standards, commonly known under the name TCN.
TCN (Train Communication Network) is a series of international standards (IEC61375) developed by Working Group 43 of the IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission), specifying a communication system for the data communication within and between vehicles of a train. It is currently in use on many thousands of trains in the world in order to allow electronic devices to exchange information while operating aboard the same train.
TCNOpen follows the Open Source scheme, as the software is jointly developed by participating companies, according to their role, so as to achieve cheaper, quicker and better quality results.
