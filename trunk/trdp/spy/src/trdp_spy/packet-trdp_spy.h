/**
 * @mainpage TRDP-SPY
 *
 * @section TRDP_intro Introduction
 *
 * @subsection TRDP_purpose Purpose
 * As part of the IP-Train project, two new protocols namely TRDP-PD (Process Data) and
 * TRDP-MD (Message Data) are intended to be supported by the Wireshark tool. The support
 * is envisaged to be made available in the form of a plug-in.
 *
 * The existing GUI of the Wireshark V1.8.3 shall not be modified. The plug-in TRDP-SPY
 * shall be available as a DLL for Windows platform and shared library for TRDP-spy for Linux
 * platform.
 *
 * @subsection TRDP_audience Intended Audience
 * The TRDP-SPY will be used primarily by TRDP Engineers.
 *
 *
 * @section TRDP_design Design Description
 *
 * @subsection TRDP_system System
 * TRDP Wire Protocol Analysis tool (TRDP-SPY) shall provide qualitative and quantitative
 * analysis of TRDP streams, in order to verify system behaviour during qualification tests (level
 * 2 and level 3) and provide help in problem analysis during train integration and debugging.
 *
 * @subsection TRDP_opEnv Operational Environment
 * The plug-in shall be compatible with Windows XP and Linux implementation of Wireshark.
 * Standard behavior of Wireshark for all other protocols than WP shall not be influenced in
 * any way by the TRDPWP analysis plug-in.
 *
 * The plug-in shall be delivered as a DLL (Windows) along with the Wireshark-setup.exe and
 * shared Library (.la, .lai and .so files or Linux) along with the minimal source - Wireshark-1.8.3.
 *
 * @section TRDP_devWin Development Environment for Windows
 *
 * Following specifications are used for development of the TRDP PD and TRDP MD plug-in for Wireshark.
 * @li Operating System: Windows XP
 * @li Tool : Wireshark V1.8.3
 * @li Programming Language: C
 * @li TRDP Wire Protocol
 *
 * @subsection TRDP_compileWin Steps to compile for Windows
 * Prerequisites:
 * @li Wireshark minimal source (wireshark-1.8.3.tar.bz2).
 * @li @c TRDP-SPY_src.zip source.
 * @li Follow the online guide http://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/ChSetupWin32.html
 *
 * Steps:
 * @li Unzip @c wireshark-1.8.3.tar.bz2 to @c c:\ and rename it to @c wireshark.
 * @li Unzip @c TRDP-SPY_src.zip.
 * @li From @c TRDP-SPY_src source copy folders @ctrdp_spy to <tt>c:/wireshark/plugins</tt>.
 * @li Also copy @c config.nmake from @c TRDP-SPY to <tt>c:\\wireshark</tt> (overwrite the existing one).
 * @li Open a Terminal and navigate to the plugin location <tt>C:\\wireshark\\plugins\\trpd_spy\\</tt>.
 * @li First clean it using command <tt>nmake -f makefile.nmake distclean</tt> or run @c clean.bat.
 * @li Then compile using command <tt>nmake -f makefile.nmake</tt> or run @c build.bat.
 *
 * This will generate the @c TRDP_spy.dll.
 *
 * The Wireshark version containing TRDP can be started with: \n
 * <tt>C:\\wireshark\\wireshark-gtk2\\wireshark.exe</tt>
 *
 *
 * @section TRDP_devLinux Development Environment for Linux
 * Following specifications are used for development of the TRDP PD and TRDP MD plug-in for Wireshark.
 * @li Operating System: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS-Linux
 * @li Tool : Wireshark v 1.8.3
 * @li Programming Language: C
 *
 * @subsection TRDP_compLinux Steps to compile and install Wireshark on Linux:
 * Prerequisites:
 * @li Wireshark source ( @c wireshark-1.8.3.tar.bz ).
 * @li @c TRDP-SPY_src.zip.
 *
 * Steps:
 * Unzip wireshark-1.8.3.tar.bz with command on Console and not by using @c tar to unzip:
 *
 * <tt>$ tar xjvf Wireshark-1.8.3.tar.bz</tt>
 *
 * Now execute the following commands to compile and install Wireshark
 *
 * <tt> $ cd wireshark-1.8.3</tt><br />
 * <tt> $ ./configure wireshark-prefix=/opt/local</tt><br />
 * <tt> $ make</tt><br />
 * <tt> $ make install</tt><br />
 * <tt> $ /opt/local/bin/wireshark (to launch Wireshark)</tt><br />
 *
 * Integrate TRDP-SPY into this wireshark version.
 *
 * Unzip TRDP-SPY.zip.
 * Now copy folder @c TRDP_spy location <tt>wireshark-1.8.3/plugins/</tt> and compile the plugin with the give following commands.
 *
 * <tt> $ cd ../wireshark-1.8.3/plugins/trdp_spy</tt><br />
 * <tt> $ make clean</tt><br />
 * <tt> $ make</tt><br />
 * Please refer <tt>wireshark-1.8.3/readme</tt> and <tt>wireshark-1.8.3/install</tt> for more reference.
 *
 * @section TRDPinterface Interface
 *
 * The plug-in shall be delivered as a DLL i.e. TRDP_spy.dll for Windows platform and shared library @c packet-trdp_spy.so files for Linux platform.
 * For Application Data decoding additional @c libxml2.dll for Windows and @c libxml2.a, @c libxml2.la and libxml2.so for Linux are required
 * which functions to parse the @c TRDP_config.xml file that contains the details of the Data-sets corresponding to each frame that is captured or logged by Wireshark.
 *
 * Overall interface of the system can be explained as shown in the figure below:

 * @image html interfaceDiagram.png "Interface Diagram" width=17cm*
 * @image latex interfaceDiagram.png "Interface Diagram" width=17cm
 *
 * @section TRDPusecase Usecase
 *
 * The TRDP-SPY plugin is interated into @c Wireshark as described:
 *
 * @image html seqDiagram.png "Live Functionality Sequence Diagram" width=10cm
 * @image latex seqDiagram.png "Live Functionality Sequence Diagram" width=10cm
 *
 * On startup the plugin is registered in Wireshark, so the corresponding TCP and UDP packets are sent to this plugin.
 * Each fitting packet is analyzed by the @c trdp_dissect .
